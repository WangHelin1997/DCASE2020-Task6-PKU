# Audio captioning DCASE 2020 system by PKU team

A Pytorch implementation of the technical report : ["Automated Audio Captioning With Temporal Attention"](http://dcase.community/documents/challenge2020/technical_reports/DCASE2020_Wang_5_t6.pdf)

We got the 3rd place in the DCASE2020 challenge.

The basic settings were following the DCASE 2020 baseline system.

See https://github.com/audio-captioning/dcase-2020-baseline for details.

Our audio captioning system is based on the sequence-to-sequence model. Convolutional neural network (CNN) is used as the encoder and a long-short term memory (LSTM)-based decoder with temporal attention is used to generate the captions. No extra data or pre-trained models are employed and no extra annotations are used. The experimental results show that our system could achieve the SPIDEr of 0.172 (official baseline: 0.054) on the evaluation split of the Clotho dataset."
